# churn analytics
Churn analytics is the process of measuring the rate at which customers quit the product, site, or service.
What is customer churn?
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is when a customer essentially stops being a customer—ie, they choose to stop using your products or services. The customer churn rate is the rate at which your customers stop doing business with you. Every company experiences churn—the key is to understand why your customers are churning and decrease the churn rate.
